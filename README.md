# CoachFit - An AI-driven Personal Trainer (POC)

### Description
CoachFit is a fully fledged personal trainer application that utilizes machine learning to help individuals access the same, curated & personalized training offered by a personal gym instructor. It uses PoseNet to map joints and Matrix Algebra to calculate angles & distances. The application is able to count repetitions/sets & provide advice on the workout's form in real-time. <ins>The Pitch Deck for CoachFit is available above</ins> and can be referred to for more context & information. The POC can be run after extraction with ```npm i && npm run build && npm run preview```.

### Tech Stack
- PoseNet by ML5.js
- Vue 3

### APP-A-THON by SRM CINTEL
CoachFit was created for a 24h Hackathon organized by SRM's Computational Intelligence dept. Team Luminals (solo team) won IInd for the same, and received a cash prize. Judges were CINTEL's HOD & Group Lead Manager for HCL Tech.

### Author's Note
This POC is *not* the best way to execute CoachFit. A more effecient way would be to train models for the workouts.
